# Network-Compression

Network Compression is the technique of optimising a deep learning model by reducing the number of parameters. In our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03833.pdf), we do this by  

This repository contains our TensorFlow implementation of Network-Compression for [AdapNet++](https://github.com/DeepSceneSeg/AdapNet-pp), which allows you to compress your own model on any dataset and evaluate results in terms of the mean IoU metric.
